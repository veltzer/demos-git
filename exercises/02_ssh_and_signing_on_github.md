# Ssh private/public keys and GPG keys for signing

This exercise has two parts but first you must do the following:
* sign up to GitHub, if you already have an account then don't and just
    use your existing account.
    [URL](https://github.com)
* for windows users:
    install gitbash and accept all defaults and you will have the tools you need for this
    exercise (GPG and ssh-keygen).

Part1: ssh access to GitHub
* follow GitHub instructions on creating and registering an ssh key.
    [URL](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    [URL](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
    * You don't really need to do the ssh-agent stuff
    * Pay attention to create a key without a password (insist on it twice and it will work)
    * Remember to configure GitHub to accept the key that you created (add it to your ssh keys collection
    on GitHub)
* show that you clone pull and push from GitHub without supplying a user/password which means that you are
    using your newly minted keys.

Part2: signing your commits
* follow GitHub instructions on creating and registering a GPG key.
    [URL](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
    [URL](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification)
    * Pay attention to create a key with the same email and name of your GitHub
    * Pay attention to create a key without a password (insist on it twice and it will work)
    account
    If generating the key takes too long here is how to speed it up:

* create a new github repository called "gpg-sign-demo"
* clone it
* create a commit and sign it.
    1) make sure that under [user] name, email and signingkey have the right data and identical
    to your data at github. signing key needs to be the last 8 digits of your key id as shown
    from gpg --list-keys
    2) create a commit and sign it with:
        $ git commit -S -m "message"
    optionally: put the following snippet in your ~/.gitconfig or .git/config files:
    ===========>8===============
    [commit]
    gpgsign = true
    ===========>8===============
    in order to sign every commit
* push it to github.
* verity that you commit is signed
    go to the github website, find your repository, find your commit and see that is has the green
    [verified] box at it's description.
