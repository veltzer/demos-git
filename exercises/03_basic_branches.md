# Basic Branches

* Create a repository with an initial commit
    `$ git init [repo_name]`
    and create a first commit
* Create several commits on top of the initial commit.
* Branch out to branch "branch1"
    `$ git branch [branchname]`
* Create several commits on top of branch1
* Return to master
* Add several commits
* Branch to "branch2"
* Move (either push or pull) commits from branch1 to branch2
* Collapse the branch2 branch to master
    go to master and pull changes from branch 2 using:
    `$ git pull . branch2`
* update branch1 from master
    go to branch1 and pull from master using:
    `$ git pull . master`
* collapse branch1 to master
    go to master and pull from branch1:
    `$ git pull . branch1`
* delete branches branch1 and branch2
    `$ git branch -d branch1`
    `$ git branch -d branch2`
