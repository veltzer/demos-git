Exercise in gihub integration: ssh private/public keys and gpg keys for signing
=======================================================
This exercise has two parts but first you must do the following:
- sign up to github, if you already have an account then don't and just
	use your existing account.
	https://github.com
- for windows users:
	install gitbash and accept all defaults and you will have the tools you need for this
	exercise (gpg and ssh-keygen).

Part1: ssh access to github
- follow github instructions on creating and registering an ssh key.
	https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
	* You don't really need to do the ssh-agent stuff
	* Pay attention to create a key without a password (insist on it twice and it will work)
	* Remember to configure github to accept the key that you created (add it to your ssh keys collection
	on github)
- show that you clone pull and push from github without supplying a user/password which means that you are
	using your newly minted keys.

Part2: signing your commits
- follow github instructions on creating and registering a gpg key.
	https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key
	https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification
	* Pay attention to create a key with the same email and name of your github
	* Pay attention to create a key without a password (insist on it twice and it will work)
	account
	If generating the key takes too long here is how to speed it up:

- create a new github repositroy called "gpg-sign-demo"
- clone it
- create a commit and sign it.
	1) make sure that under [user] name, email and signingkey have the right data and identical
	to your data at github. signing key needs to be the last 8 digits of your key id as shown
	from gpg --list-keys
	2) create a commit and sign it with:
		$ git commit -S -m "message"
	optionally: put the following snipplet in your ~/.gitconfig or .git/config files:
	===========>8===============
	[commit]
	gpgsign = true
	===========>8===============
	in order to sign every commit
- push it to github.
- verity that you commit is signed
	go to the github website, find your repository, find your commit and see that is has the green
	[verified] box at it's description.
